------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DEVELOPMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting out. Reading and making sure I understand all the requirments. Going
to copy over the base driver from homework 6, get that up and running and
able to read in dynamic buffer sizes. Also I would like to make sure that
all the memory is allocated and freed correctly since that has been an issue 
in the past.


Got the Makefile, dynamic buffer size, line read in, and driver working. Also
already ran it through valgrind and was able to ensure that there were no
memory links. Need to format the data some more and then can start working on
the equations.


Turns out i did all the allocations myself when they were already mostly
declared in the file. I have reconfigured and so far all of the data is able
to be processed and placed correctly into properly alocated matracies for both
matracies, ivector and rvectors.

Now going to work on the equations portions.

Checked in valgrind and everything is air tight so far, no memory leaks


Seem to have the LU factorization portion working. All though when I look up
how LU factorization is done vs gaussian elimination, it seems that they both
have very different yet similar approches, but ultimatly get the same result,
so im not complaining.

Still need to make it more robust in case it can not find a factor.

Turns out my P code that was suppost to set up the P vector was horribly wrong
Just fixed it and got it working.

Created the back subsitution code, but it wasnt getting the values. Found out
there was ONE place where i wasnt putting in the b values correctly and now
it works! just need to work on making it a bit more robust.


Some of the inputs work, others dont. Going to get the gsl test to work
and then I can compare and contrast the results and see whats up.

Got GSL test to work suprisingly quickly. The code is very messy but I can
fix that up laters.


GOT IT ALL WORKING!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg what a roller coaster. Now going to work on the robustness/data input
catching as well as the timing.... but the brute of the algorithms are OVER

Re-ran mem, all memeory is gooooood.


Now trying to get it to work with rand.txt. Already came across a seg fault


GOT IT WORKING!! Rand.txt now works, the issue was that I has local variables
that were not malloced. I checked the first and last value of X to make sure
that the results were similar and they were! Also added some more robustnees,
so now will start doing the verbose flags and data collection.


Currently:


GEX.txt OUTPUT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ge1.txt | produces the same results from both my implementation and gsl.
	| Online calculators also confirm the values

ge2.txt | produces the same results from both my implementation and gsl.
	| I did not check with an online calculator but the p matrix and
	| Values are the same across mine and the gsl implementation

ge3.txt | currently produces a error that is handeld by saying that the 
	| file is not in the proper format. May change this later

ge4.txt | Hits the statement where a solution cannot be found but it is still
	| able to produce a p and LU vector/matrix

rand.txt | gsl and my implementation produces the same results as far as i 
	 | can tell from when I look at it.



so GSL and my implemenetation both produce the correct results as far as my
testing can tell.

Now going to perform timing scenarios. 

Just ran the timing setup. My current timing areas are right next to the 
computation functions with mininal mallocs and prints inbetween to get the 
most accurate results


TIMING DATA
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gsl implementation	
	Elimination	:	5.26 sec
	Solution	:	0.01 sec
	 
custom implementation	
	Elimination	:	18.10 sec
	Solution	:	0.07 sec


I re-ran it and got pretty much the same results +/- 0.05 sec for the 
elimination times.

This puts my performance rations at:

Elimination ratio	:	18.10/5.26 	= 3.44
Solution ratio		:	0.07/0.01 	= 7
Total Ratio		:	18.17/5.27	= 3.45


**NOTE**
Verbose flag works, but needs to be set to either <NOTHING> as in "VERBOSE = "
or "VERBOSE = "verb"".

There are NO memory leaks! 

The GLS program is not nearly as robust, ge4 runs into an error. and there
may be memory leaks in the GLS program. The output is not as pretty too.

Other than that all requirments should be fuffiled.



In conclusion:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was able to succesfully implement the algorthims with proper functionality
and I believe proper robustness. The Timing results were promising, as my
implementation was only 3 times slower than the GSL implemenation. Obviously
GLS is much better, but I am happy with my results considering it could of
easily be 15 or 30 times larger.



Thank you
