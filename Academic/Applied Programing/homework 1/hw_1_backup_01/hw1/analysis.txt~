Part D: All 3 quadratic equations seemed to produce accurate
        results. It appears everything is functioning correctly.
	The only issue that I had seen was when QuadraticSovler
	is built, there is a warning because the final Return
	value may not be used. But other than that it seems to
	work perfetly
