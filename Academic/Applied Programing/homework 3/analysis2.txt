For analysis of the optomized C program for speed and size
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**NOTE
It should be noted that the Makefile was modified for the optomized section so
that the outputs would go to ls2.txt and size2.txt

Each change was test compiled with O0, O1, O2, and O3 respectivly.


In order to optomize the code, the first thing done was loop Unrolling. The
loop was unrolled 4 times and tested with O0, O1, O2 and O3 5 times each.

Here were the unoptomized results at O0:

	data iteration time ave		: 0.07 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.000032 s

with its size being: 11368
	

The results were as follows:

O0
	data iteration time ave		: 0.084 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.000035 s

O1
	data iteration time ave		: 0.016 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.00001 s

O2
	data iteration time ave		: 0.016 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.000007 s

O3
	data iteration time ave		: 0.014 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.000007 s

with O0 size being 11194

As the data shows, the O0 calculations were actually slightly longer by 2e-6.
This may be becasue the loop unrappiing perfomred an if statment since the
code at the beggining. However, the O~ operations were able to drastically
improve both the data iteration time as well as the calculation time.



Loop unrolling was attempted again, this time with an unrolling value of 8.
The results were as follows.

O0
	data iteration time ave		: 0.066 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.000034 s

O1
	data iteration time ave		: 0.018 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.00001 s

O2
	data iteration time ave		: 0.016 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.000007 s

O3
	data iteration time ave		: 0.014 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.000007 s



As the results show, there was an improvement of 0.000001 from the unrolling
value of 4, but that was still slower by 0.000002.

Based on the data, the loop unrolling attempt seemed to be ineffective and was
removed.


The next optomization technique was increasing the data size form 1 to 100.
The following were the results:

O0
	data iteration time ave		: 0.003 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.000032 s

O1
	data iteration time ave		: 0.002 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.00001 s

O2
	data iteration time ave		: 0.002 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.000007 s

O3
	data iteration time ave		: 0.002 s
	calculation iteration time ave	: 0.000007 s

This had a major performance increase. At the base of O0, taking the data
iteration time from 0.07 to 0.003. Thats a factor of 10 increase. 




Based on these performance techniques, it was determined that the best, most
effective solution was to increease the data allocation size to 100 and
compile the code using either O2 or O3. Doing these techniques would bring
the codes:
	data iteration time form 0.06s to 0.003s
	caculation iteration time from 0.000032 s to 0.000007s
	size from 11327 to 6010.


Our efforts helped contribute to make the world a better place.
