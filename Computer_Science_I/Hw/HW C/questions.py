a. Were you able to completely fix the problems?
   If not, explain in detail cases that still fail.
   What tools did you use (pdb, idle, pycharm, others?)?
ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE:

I believe I was able to competly fix the problems. All though, I had to create two instances of drawI to complete the first one and compile them into drawII, but the outcome was
the same. Also, with problem two, I believe I answered the problems but am not sure if there is any more test cases I should run.
The tools I used for debugging this program was Idle debugger and a little help from some friends.



b. What features and services of the debugger did you find useful?
ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE:

I found using the step feture very useful for locating the issues as well as inserting print() in some instances during problem2.



c. List the steps you took in debugging.
ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE:

First I ran the problems to see what was going wrong.
Then I tampered with the code by changing some variables and re-ordering some items to better understaned the code.
From there I used Idls, Debugger to better understand and locate the issues.
After that, I did a combination of idle debugger and tampering with the code until I got to a reasonable conclusion.



d. What went well? Describe briefly; phrases will do.
ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE:

What I found most useful was tampering with the code to see outcomes rather than using the debugger but also found the debugger helpful at times. Specifically during problem two is when
I used the debugger most on that area.



e. What troubles did you have? Describe briefly; phrases will do.
ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE:

The most troubles I had debugging was on first one, figuring out how to reflect the I and eventually just did drawI twice and created a new function entierly.
Also on problem2 there was some issue getting the final results but I believe that I was able to get the desired outcomes.
